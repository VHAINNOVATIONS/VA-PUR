application (“Application”) on your device and by
subsequent use of the Licensed Software, you agree to
comply with the terms of this general End User License
Agreement ("EULA") and Notice of Privacy Practices
(“Notice”). If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA
and Notice, do not access or use the Licensed Software
from your device. This EULA and Notice applies to any
upgrades and supplements to the original Licensed
Software provided and is referred to on your opening
screen. A copy of the EULA is available from within the
Licensed Software. It is your responsibility to review any
future changes to the EULA and to refrain from using the
software if you do not agree to the terms.

The Licensed Software is owned by VA. The Licensed
Software is licensed, not sold, only on the terms of this
EULA. Acceptance and use of the software indicates your
acceptance of the terms and conditions of this EULA.

Upon accessing the Licensed Software, you will acquire the
right to use the Licensed Software, directly from VA. You
assume responsibility for the selection of the program to
achieve your intended results, and for the access, use and
results obtained from the Licensed Software.

VA and you acknowledge that this Agreement is concluded
between VA and you only, and not with your hardware
manufacturer, operating system vendor, or organization
that provided the mechanism to access the software. VA is
solely responsible for the Licensed Software and its
content.

In consideration of your acceptance of the terms and
conditions contained in this EULA, VA grants you a nonexclusive
license to use the Licensed Software and the
associated documentation for your own needs on any
iPhone or iPod touch that you own or control and as
permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the App Store
Terms of Service. You are not licensed to rent, lease,
transfer, or distribute the Licensed Software.

Title to the Licensed Software, including media and
documentation, remain with VA. You may not copy or
reproduce, except as supported by the Licensed Software,
in whole or in part, or as is necessary for back-up or
archival purposes. You may not reverse engineer, translate,
disassemble, decompile the software or create similar
software in whole or in part.

The license is effective upon acceptance and access to the
Licensed Software and shall continue with any subsequent
use of the application. VA has the right to terminate this
Agreement if you fail to comply with any term or condition
of this EULA. Upon termination you shall stop all use of

Confidentiality of the Licensed Software will survive any
termination of this EULA, to include the application,
design, and functionality.

This Licensed Software is distributed free, AS IS, in the
hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. Your hardware manufacturer, operating system
vendor, or organization that provided the mechanism has
no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the
Licensed Software, and any other claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to
conform to any warranty will be VA’s sole responsibility.

In no event will VA be liable for any damages, including for
loss of data, loss of use, or indirect, special, incidental or
consequential damages in any way related to or arising out
of the use of the Licensed Software whether based upon
warranty, contract, or otherwise, whether or not injury was
sustained by persons or property or otherwise, and whether
or not loss was sustained from, or arose out of use of
Licensed Software. You agree to waive any and all claims
against the U.S. Government, VA, its employees, its
contractors, their subcontractors, and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the U.S. Government, its contractors, and
their subcontractors for any damage that you may incur
from your use of the Licensed Software. VA, not your
hardware manufacturer, operating system vendor, or
organization that provided the mechanism to access the
Licensed Software, is responsible for addressing any claims
by you or any third party relating to the Licensed Software
or your possession and/or use of that Licensed Software,
including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims;
(ii) any claim that the Licensed Software fails to conform to
any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii)
claims arising under consumer protection or similar
legislation. The EULA does not limit VA’s liability to you
beyond what is permitted by applicable law.

VA shall be neither liable nor responsible for any
maintenance or updating of the provided Licensed
Software, nor for correction of any errors in the Licensed
Software. The VA may discontinue the Licensed Software,
potentially, but not necessarily, replacing it with a
subsequent product. Compatibility of data between
products is not guaranteed. VA and you acknowledge that
Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any
maintenance and support services with respect to the
Licensed Software.

This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with federal law and each party agrees to be
subject to those relevant laws for all purposes.
It is understood and acknowledged that VA has the
absolute right to obtain injunctive relief to protect VA's
proprietary rights.

By using the Licensed Software, you further agree that this
is the complete and exclusive statement of the Agreement
which supersedes any proposal or prior agreement, oral or
written, and any other communications relating to the
subject matter of this EULA.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions will not be
affected.

By agreeing to use VA software that allows you to access
your health data, you are further agreeing based upon
individual end-user access permissions to allow the
application to access and display your available electronic
personal health information from VA systems after proper
identification and authentication.

Some applications may provide access to other Web sites
outside VA control and jurisdiction. When you link to these
Web sites, your communications no longer are protected by
our privacy policies. VA is not responsible for the privacy
practices or the content of non-VA Web sites. We
encourage you to review the privacy policy or terms and
conditions of those sites to fully understand what
information is collected and how it is used.

You have a responsibility to keep your health information
safe. While VA ensures privacy and security of your
personal health information while the data is in VA
systems, VA cannot ensure privacy once you remove a copy
of your information from a VA system. Once information is
downloaded, saved, printed, emailed, faxed or shared by
other method, its protection is up to you. When using an
Application that allows display of your health information,
remember that people may see your personal information
on the screen. Turn the screen away from their view. Do
not walk away from the mobile device or computer with
your information showing. Always remember to log off
when you have finished. If you must write information
down, keep them in a safe place. If you print copies of your
personal health information, be careful not to leave it in
any public places and store copies in a safe place, like a
locked file cabinet. If you share your personal health
information with others, VA has no authority to ensure
these people protect your privacy. Be careful of who you
give copies of your personal health information, whether
the information was entered by you or is from a VA system.
Be sure to destroy printed copies of your health
information preferably with a shredder. You are
encouraged to enhance the security of your information by
taking actions on any mobile device or computer used to
access your health information.

Recommended actions include but are not limited to:
- Use a password to protect access to your device. Ensure
that your password is easy for you to remember but difficult
for others to guess.
- Use the autolock feature and/or timeout feature on your
device.
- Do not jailbreak your device or download apps from
sources other than designated app stores as these actions
may expose you to security risk.
